# PHY202 (Python) Programming for Physicists — Materials
[ASU Online](https://asuonline.asu.edu/) class [PHY202 (Python) Programming for Physicists](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/learning/128/phy202-programming-for-physicists).

PHY202 is a fully online class that provides an introduction to programming in the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language for physics majors. Although the examples are drawn from first year physics, anyone who is familiar with Newton’s equations of motions and ordinary differential equations will be able to follow. The overall goal is to enable students to write programs to solve their own numerical problems, no matter where the problems come from.

No programming experience is required. Although only 1 credit hour, the class is intense and requires the student to be serious about wanting to learn programming.

The class was designed as part of the new ASU [Online BA in Physics](https://www.physics.asu.edu/content/physics-0) (see also [description at ASU Online](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/physics-ba/)) but can be taken by anyone fullfiling the [prerequisites](https://becksteinlab.physics.asu.edu/learning/128/phy202-programming-for-physicists#requirements).
